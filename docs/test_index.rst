CRISPR Comparison Toolkit (CCTK)
================================

**CCTK** is a Python toolkit for the identification and comparison of CRISPR arrays.
CCTK includes tools to go from assemblies to publication-quality images and is built around simple file formats to allow users to easily fit CCTK tools into existing workflows.

See the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
:ref:`installation` instructions.
